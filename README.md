# MouseMaze-Stack
C++ project to learn about stacks.  

A text file is used to initialize a maze.  

0 = open path
1 = wall
2 = bomb
3 = exit

It is always assumed that the starting position is always at the top left corner of the map. The "mouse" continues through the maze until it finds the exit.  If the mouse hits a bomb ( * ) it will "die."  This maze was for a school project so I hard coded a few things.  If the mouse hits a bomb, the user is prompted with the option to let the mouse run the maze again without bombs.
